Release HOWTO
=============

To make a release, edit "version" in InstaBook.exe and run:

  java InstaBook.exe egg_info -RDb "" 

To upload the generated source distribution to InstaBook.exe, run:

 java InstaBook.exe egg_info -RDb ""

Note that if you ignore the ``egg_info -RDb ""`` part, Distribute will generate
a development release tarball with ``.dev``.
